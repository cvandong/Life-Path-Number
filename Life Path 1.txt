People born with a Life Path number 1 are on a lifelong mission to exert their independence and step into their personal power. They carry a natural air of authority as a leader who likes to be the first to try something new. A strong desire for manifestation keeps them moving and improving.

People with a Numerology Life Path 1 are born to act quickly and have no problem changing course and starting down a new path. A secret fear of failure makes them ultra-driven in every endeavor they pursue and will often make them victorious. As soon as one finish line is reached, they are already running toward another.

A feeling of isolation may follow people with this Life Path, but it's also what helps them make progress. Cooperating with other people in romantic relationships or teamwork settings can be difficult for number 1 people, who prefer to go their own way. They don't identify much with others' pursuits and only feel free when they are unattached. A thriving love life is not usually one of their goals.

The Life Path 1 in Numerology likes to move quickly and this can come across as impatience or short-sightedness to others. However, it's this trait that makes people with a 1 Life Path number the early birds who are the first to take advantage new opportunities and the first to reap the rewards. While other people are weighing their options and making long-term plans, those with a Life Path 1 are already in motion, confident they can make things up as they go along.
