The 22 Life Path is called the "Master Builder" because it has a very special power to turn nebulous dreams into concrete realities. These people are spiritually connected and feel both a responsibility and a burden to use their cosmic gift to better the future of our world. And though it may take years to master to their life purpose, what a 22 Life Path can achieve is exceptional.

One of the things that set a Life Path 22 apart from others is their extreme dedication. They aren't afraid of putting in the hard work -- but this isn't about climbing the corporate ladder. They feel an allegiance to others, working hard to be of service to others and improving humankind in some way. This can lead to a fear of failure, but they can turn this around and use it as motivation to keep pushing forward.

Those with a Life Path number 22 are not only able to lead themselves, but others as well. They don't rely on their emotions, but this can come at a cost as they sometimes come across as "all work and no play." However, they understand the value of cooperation and know that those who go far go together.

Fulfillment for someone with a Master Number 22 comes in the form of seeing how their hard work has come to fruition. Their ambition is unmatched, and nobody sets the bar higher than they do, so they need to know they've done a good job. By embracing their abilities and knowledge, they will be able to do just that.
