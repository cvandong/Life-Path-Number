The knowledge they have gained can be incredibly valuable to others on their own journeys.

A person who is born with a Life Path 9 tends to be spiritual and connects deeply with religion. Whether it stems from a need for strength during times of struggle or a natural desire to relate to something greater than themselves, Life Path number 9 people often seek courage and meaning from a higher source. Intuitions and gut reactions may even outweigh logic. This connection to the divine gives these people a safety net of confidence as they continue to make their way through life's good times and bad.

People with a Life Path 9 may feel a great devotion to their fellow man. They are humanitarians by nature and use their big hearts to support those who have been made to feel inequal or unworthy. But because 9 Life Path people have become so accustomed to enduring their own challenges, others may not notice when they are in need and, unfortunately, they have a very difficult time asking for help. People with this Life Path number must realize that assistance is part of a cycle of give and take, and with as much support as they give, it's their karmic responsibility to receive support in return.
